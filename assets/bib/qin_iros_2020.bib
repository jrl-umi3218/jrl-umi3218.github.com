  abstract  = {Deformable  objects  are  very  common  around  usin  our  daily  life.  Because  they  have  infinitely  many  degreesof  freedom,  they  present  a  challenging  problem  in  robotics.Inspired  by  practical  industrial  applications,  we  present  inthis  paper  our  research  on  using  a  humanoid  robot  to  takea  long,  thin  and  flexible  belt  out  of  a  bobbin  and  pick  upthe bending part of the belt from the ground. By proposing anovel  non-prehensile  manipulation  strategy  \textquotedblleft scraping\textquotedblright   whichutilizes  the  friction  between  the  gripper  and  the  surface  ofthe  belt,  efficient  manipulation  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,a  3D  shape  detection  algorithm  for  deformable  objects  isused  during  manipulation  process.  By  integrating  the  novel\textquotedblleft scraping\textquotedblright  motion and the shape detection algorithm into ourmulti-objective  QP-based  controller,  we  show  experimentallyhumanoid robots can complete this complex task.}
