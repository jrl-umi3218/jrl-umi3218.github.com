  abstract  = {This paper deals with the motion planning of a polyarticulated robotic system for which support contacts are allowed to occur between any part of the body and any part of the environment. Starting with a description of the environment and of a target, it computes a sequence of postures that allow our system to reach its target. We describe a very generic architecture of this planner, highly modular, as well as a first implementation of it. We then present our results, both simulations and real experiments, for a simple grasping task using the HRP-2 humanoid robot.}
