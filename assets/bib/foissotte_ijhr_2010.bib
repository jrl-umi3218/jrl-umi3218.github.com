  abstract  = {An original method to build a visual model for unknown objects by a humanoid robot is proposed. The algorithm ensures successful autonomous realization of this goal by addressing the problem as an active coupling between computer vision and whole-body posture generation. The visual model is built through the repeated execution of two processes. The first one considers the current knowledge about the visual aspects and the shape of the object to deduce a preferred viewpoint with the aim of reducing the uncertainty of the shape and appearance of the object. This is done while considering the constraints related to the embodiment of the vision sensors in the humanoid head. The second process generates a whole robot posture using the desired head pose while solving additional constraints such as collision avoidance and joint limitations. The main contribution of our approach relies on the use of different optimization algorithms to find an optimal viewpoint by including the humanoid specificities in terms of constraints, an embedded vision sensor, and redundant motion capabilities. This approach differs significantly from those of traditional works addressing the problem of autonomously building an object model.},
