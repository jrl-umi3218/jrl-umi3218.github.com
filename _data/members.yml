  research: >
    <p>How should rehabilitation, biomedical and social robots behave such that an interacting human is comfortable with them, feels safe with them and is willing to coexist and learn from them? The answer to this questions is not trivial because human interactions, both with their environment and other humans, have complex dynamics that change not only with an interacting individual’s physiology, age and pathology, but also emotional factors like fear and anxiety, and cognitive factors like the Theory of Mind. The reason we can intuitively interact with a fellow human is because we understand his/her behaviour in all these aspects and respond accordingly, and correspondingly he/she does the same. My research aims to endow machines and robots with similar capabilities to understand humans through the development of _Human Centric Robotics_**.

    received the Master’s degree in computer sciences and applied mathematics (Geometry, Image, and CAD) from Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France, in 2014. From November 2014 to March 2019, he was a Research Engineer with the Interactive Digital Human Group, CNRS-UM Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics, and Microelectronics, where he was responsible for the software development and experiments on the HRP-4 humanoid robot. He was involved in numerous European projects such as VERE (dissolves the boundary between the human body and surrogate representations in immersive virtual reality and physical reality), Robohow (enable robots to competently perform everyday human-scale manipulation activities) and Comanoid (deploy humanoid robots to achieve non-added value tasks that have been identified by Airbus Group in aircraft assembly operations). Moreover, following his Master’s degree direction he worked on robot-objects manipulation based on vision and haptics feedback that lead to publications as co-author. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in vision applied to humanoid-objects manipulation from the CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory) Tsukuba, Japan since March 2019. His work investigates the different camera modalities available on the market in order to answer to the constraints imposed by object manipulation. These modalities are evaluated in a VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) context before to be used to perform real-time object tracking and objects manipulation.

    obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and one in Computer Sciences from Sorbonne University, Paris, in 2016. He then received a Master's degree specializing in AI, Robotics, and Operational Research from the same University in 2018. After that, he was a research intern at the NII (National Institute of Informatics) in Tokyo and began a Ph.D. there under the affiliation of SOKENDAI University, from which he graduated in 2021. His thesis was about Plan Recognition in Real-Time Strategy Games, how to infer the opponent player's strategy in real-time.
    He started a postdoc at JRL in 2022, focusing on using plan recognition during teleoperation. The idea behind it is to anticipate the moves of the teleoperator and provide assistance with the robot so that the actions are less clumsy. His research interest includes AI for robotics, Decision making, Multi-agent systems, and autonomous robots.
    Otherwise, he is passionate about the progress AI makes every day and its impact on human society, passionate about space and all its mysteries,
    he likes hiking, sport, and just enjoying time with friends.

    obtained his Ph.D. in Automatics and Computer Vision in 2021 from University Burgundy Franche-Comté (Besançon, France), at the FEMTO-ST Institute of research, in the department of Mechanics and Mechatronics. His Ph.D. subject was focusing on the pose measurement at small scale, using encoded periodic patterns to obtain a range of measure larger than the field of view allowed in microscopy. These periodic patterns also allow a highly resolute retrieval of the position through the study of their phase evolution, with resolution up to 1 nm in translation and a few microradians in rotation. Prior to that, he received an engineering degree in robotics from the National Institute of Mechanics and Microtechnologies (Besançon, France).
    He joined the JRL in 2022 as a JSPS postdoctoral fellow to study the visual servoing capabilities of large field of view cameras. The core idea of this study is to enhance the servoing capabilities in robotics and avoid self-collision and joints limits while providing both a large convergence domain and a high resolution in the final positioning.
    He is now a permanent researcher at CNRS-AIST JRL and his current research interests are focused on computer vision for robotics, including visual servoing with omnidirectional cameras and deformation estimation from images.

    Antoine Caillot obtained his Ph.D. in Automatic, Signal, Industrial Production, and Robotics in 2022 from the University of Rouen (France), at IRSEEM in ESIGELEC (Rouen, France). His Ph.D. subject was focused on cooperative perception for autonomous navigation in an automotive context. These works aim to create a map of a scene at a roundabout or an intersection using light data from vehicles and infrastructure. Before that, he received an engineering degree in embedded systems for autonomous vehicles from ESIGELEC (Rouen, France).
    He joined the JRL in 2023 as a postdoctoral fellow to study Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) with emergent sensors. The goal is to improve the performances of SLAM algorithms using new image sensors such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) omniscient cameras, event-based cameras, or hyperspectral image sensors.

    obtained his Master's degree in Robotics from the Institut Supérieur des Sciences et Techniques (INSSET) of Saint-Quentin, France in 2022. He completed his studies with an internship as a research engineer working on Visual Odometry, followed by a position as a research engineer working on Visual SLAM in the Laboratoire des Technologies Innovantes of Amiens, France. In September 2023, he began a thesis with the MIS (Modélisation, Information & Systèmes, Amiens, France) and CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan) laboratories. His thesis focuses on the 3D-3D and 2D-3D point clouds registration that include non-static elements, aiming to improve their accuracy and completeness even when only a minority of the captured scene remains static. This approach will enable the application of 3D-3D and 2D-3D point cloud registration to robot localization and navigation within a common, unified paradigm. His research interests include robotic perception, especially 3D reconstruction, 3D computer vision, and SLAM.

    obtained his M.Sc. in Engineering, specializing in Computer Science, Microelectronics, and Automated Systems from Polytech Montpellier Engineering School in 2022. He carried out an internship as a Robotics and AI Engineer at GrAI Matter Labs in Paris, France, where he developed end-to-end robotics applications based on computer vision and edge-AI. Before joining JRL, he worked on Social Human-Robot Interaction topics, including the application of Generative AI techniques aimed at developing socially autonomous agents based on LLM for robotics. Additionally, during his research internship at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan, he co-authored a conference paper for TEI 2022 on embodied interaction, focusing on using social robots to deliver speeches by analyzing human poses and facial expressions using deep learning. Currently, he is a Ph.D. researcher at JRL, where his research focuses on Safety Oriented Control in Physical Human-Robot Interaction.

    received a Master's degree in Mechatronics from École Normale Supérieure de Rennes, France, in 2019. He then received a Ph.D. in Robotics from the University of Toulouse, France, in 2022 after working 3 years at LAAS-CNRS, France, as part of the Gepetto team. His thesis focused on developping a model predictive control architecture able to exploit the dynamical capabilities of a lightweight quadruped robot. He continued working in the Gepetto team as a postdoc until April 2024. During that time he explored quadruped locomotion using reinforcement learning approaches. He started a postdoc at JRL in May 2024 through the JSPS program. His current work focuses on reinforcement learning locomotion for humanoid robots.
