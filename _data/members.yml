    <h3>Research interests</h3>
    <p>How should rehabilitation, biomedical and social robots behave such that an interacting human is comfortable with them, feels safe with them and is willing to coexist and learn from them? The answer to this questions is not trivial because human interactions, both with their environment and other humans, have complex dynamics that change not only with an interacting individual’s physiology, age and pathology, but also emotional factors like fear and anxiety, and cognitive factors like the Theory of Mind. The reason we can intuitively interact with a fellow human is because we understand his/her behaviour in all these aspects and respond accordingly, and correspondingly he/she does the same. My research aims to endow machines and robots with similar capabilities to understand humans through the development of _Human Centric Robotics_**.
