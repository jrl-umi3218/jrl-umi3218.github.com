<p>In Roman mythology, Janus represents the transition from the past to the future, like the one we are seeing today with new technologies. It also represents bridges and connections, like the ones we are building between humans and robots: two entities into the same body.</p>

<p>JANUS is a bi-located team that gathers expertise from the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the French National Centre for Scientific Research CNRS (CNRS), namely CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL) and <a href=https://www.lirmm.fr/>LIRMM</a>, <a href=https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm_eng/research/teams/idh>Interactive Digital Human</a> laboratory in Montpellier. These teams have extensive experience in humanoid robotics, haptics, brain computer interfaces, control, telerobotics and telepresence, embodiment and physical avatars. AIST is the co-developer with Kawada industries of the world renown HRP humanoid families and the main developer of the HRP Miim, the first effectively walking geminoid called cybernetic human and has extensive expertise in humanoid robotics. CNRS posses the only HRP-4 humanoid present in Europe. CNRS and AIST to some extent, were also partners of the EU Virtual Embodiment and Robotic Re-Embodiment (VERE) project where a telepresence embodiment station featuring advanced multi-modal feedback decodes the participant’s motor intentions at the EEG brain level to control humanoid robots even over large distances. CNRS with AIST joint efforts in the last EU Comanoid project where humanoid robots are envisioned to work in large-scale aeronautics manufacturing.</p>

<b>Why are we competing in ANA Avatar XPRIZE?</b>

<p>Our main mission is to create and advance knowledge for the well-being of humanity and society. Challenging competitions like ANA Avatar XPRIZE are the technological catalyzers for new ideas and technologies. Furthermore, the Covid19 outbreak highlighted the need for such an avatar technology in healthcare services, frail persons homes, as well as many other economical and societal sectors.</p>

<b>Which have been the biggest challenges?</b>

<p>The biggest challenge is the seamless integration of existing and new technologies into a reliable architecture. Particularly, the transparency of the teleoperation is extremely challenging in anthropomorphic robotic systems. When using a humanoid robot as an avatar, the sensory feedback scales in complexity. For example, how do you provide the dynanmic balance awareness to the human operator? How do you alleviate the lack of degrees of freedom? How do you conceive a reliable loco-manipulation shared control?</p>

  <p>Whether as rescuers in disaster areas, household helps or as “colleagues” in modern work environments: there are numerous possible areas of deployment for humanoid robots in the future. One of the major challenges on the way is to enable robots to move on two legs in different situations, without falling – even in unknown rough terrain and under possible perturbations.</p>
    <p>In the KoroiBot project, we will study the way humans walk e.g. on stairs and slopes, on soft and slippery ground or over beams and seesaws, and create mathematical models. Besides developing new optimization and learning methods for walking on two legs, we  aim to implement them in practice on real robots. In addition, the research results are to flow into planning new design principles for the next generation of robots.</p>
    <p>Besides the targeted use in robotics, we expect possible applications of the methods in medicine, e.g. for controlling intelligent artificial limbs, designing and controlling exoskeletons as well as in computer animation and in game design.</p>

    <p>ulo-skeletal systems have been developed. Placing human measurement and model-based robotic approaches as an important basis, our challenge is to overcome this difficulty also by exploiting a powerful machine learning framework to benefit from a large dataset of human motions. Consequently, we can take advantage of humanoids’ ability to interact with the physical world to refine and validate the model of the motion strategy and controller, as well as digital actors’ flexibility to change many parameters to simulate and learn motions with various shapes, dimensions, and physical models in different environments. Then, we hope to come up with a system that predicts and synthesizes human motions, notably motions involving complex contacts, in a variety of environments. As the cyber-physical human evolves, we expect it can be utilized to design ergonomic products, create robots that can support human comfortably by estimating human intention, and devise a humanoid robot that can coexist with humans naturally and safely in their proximity.</p>

    <p>接触こそが人型システムの運動記述の鍵であるとの新視点から、接触運動の継続学習・予測・生成を行う統一的な方法論の確立を目指す。人は環境と接触を伴う運動を自然に行うのに対し、その機序の解明や工学的利用に関する未解決課題は多い。それへの挑戦の一環として、申請者らは解析微分により人型システムの運動理解・最適化を行う革新的な理論基盤を構築してきた。本課題では、新たに ①サイバーフィジカルヒューマン（シミュレーション・実世界の人間・ロボット統合モデル）によるデータ取得・拡張の枠組と接触運動の一般的表現の提案、②運動逆最適化に基づく接触運動ネットワークの継続学習とデータベース構築、③逆予見制御とベクトル量子化学習の融合によるシンボル体系化と予測に包括的に取り組み、接触を伴う任意の運動の理解と生成に挑む。データベース公開により内外機関と連携を推進するとともに、分布型衣服埋め込みセンサによる作業者負担の実時間モニタリング、ロボットと人の遠隔協調による重量物運搬・組付け作業など、各種産業での生産性やQoWの向上にインパクトをもたらす実問題で成果を検証し、複雑な人の運動を予測し自然に支援するシステムを創出する。</p>

    <p>The aim of this project is to develop an unified framework of autonomous and continuous locomotion and manipulation in a constrained environment by robots which can work in repetitive, tedious, or a heavy task for humans in large-scale manufacturing.
    <p>Due to a huge search space and many constraints in such an environment, it is hard to find a feasible motion.</p>
    <p>In order to solve this problem, the motion libraries of locomotion and manipulation will be prepared from the environment primitives and the whole body trajectories corresponding to enriched contact conditions (e.g. sliding) from a virtual environment in a dynamics simulator in advance by using a sort of machine learning.</p>
    <p>Then the continuous locomotion and manipulation without interruption will be archived by executing environment measurement/recognition, a whole-body motion planning and its controller in frequent cycle from the motion libraries and sensing data.</p>
    <p>A whole-body controller will be also developed in order to adapt a real-environment by considering measurement and unmodeled errors under the constraints by introducing the knowledge of non-linear control schemes.</p>
    <p>In this way, we propose a new framework of locomotion and manipulation for robots to expand the reachable area and acquire the skills to perform new tasks.</p>

    <p>Robots can alleviate the burden of repetitive and dangerous tasks. Such robots need to be autonomous in a low-level but able to follow high-level human guidance. The interface must be such that tasks that take much burden can be semi-automatic (through shared control), leaving the high-level planning to the user through teleoperation. Collaboration of robot learning, and human guidance is necessary for solving unstructured problems. We propose a general shared autonomy framework (not targeted to specific robotic system) that will rely on Large Language Models (LLM) and propositional logic for action inference and predicting user intention, relying on an AI framework for continuously learning how to perform tasks.</p>

    <p>This study aims to bridge the gap between precise yet dangerous industrial robots and safer but less efficient collaboration counterparts by developing a unified advanced control and navigation framework. We aim to integrate this research into our existing mc_rtc control environment, building on our current control system used for various robots and tasks. Inspired by the need for industry certifications, our focus is on creating a complete system that enables robots to move and navigate more autonomously and safely in dynamic environments, including around humans. The foundation of this framework relies on theoretical guarantees of stability and convergence provided by control theory, those of optimality and performance provided by numerical optimization techniques, and the reliability provided by sensor fusion. We propose also to establish systematic benchmarking on actual robotic platforms. Finally, we aim for actual industrial applications in physical tasks and improved robot autonomy. The target robots are any multi-body robot (fixed and mobile manipulators, legged robots, etc.)</p>

    <p>The goal of this project is to develop a framework to plan multi-contact motion for a humanoid robot to perform complex tasks such as those done by human workers in large-scale manufacturing. To achieve this goal, we need to efficiently find feasible contacts from an infinite number of candidates in a confined environment. We solve this issue by focusing on future contact feasibility, which quantitatively represents how much it improves the solvability of the optimization problems for motion planning and the quality of the resulting motion. We introduce the reinforcement learning approach to predict it over the future and integrate it with optimization-based motion planning that explicitly considers the kinematics and dynamics of a humanoid robot, which enables us to generate feasible whole-body motion that is advantageous to satisfy necessary constraints over the future. We consider that this research will clarify how a humanoid robot obtains empirical intelligence to interact with an environment considering the tasks and its body structures.</p>

    <p>Many of today's industrial robotic equipment is controlled by dedicated servo amplifiers and operates based on position commands (or speed commands) from a higher-level controller. In applications where it's necessary to manipulate contact force, a method called admittance control, which modifies position commands based on information from force sensors or external force observers, is commonly used. Therefore, many industrial mechatronics devices can be described as "admittance-type," which means they are force-input and position-output systems. These devices are technically and cost-effectively mature, but they are not suited for situations where contact/non-contact changes frequently, especially where excessive force or impact might occur. This research project aims to establish a force control strategy for existing hardware of industrial and humanoid robots when subjected to overload or impact forces. To achieve this goal, a framework of nonsmooth control laws that can explicitly handle the saturation of state variables and control inputs will be utilized.</p>
