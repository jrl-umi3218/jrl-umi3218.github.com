<p>The <b>CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory), IRL3218</b> is a joint laboratory established between a French public organization CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and AIST and located at <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/dept/en_dithf.html">Department of Information Technology and Human Factors of the AIST</a> at Tsukuba. The researchers from both countries are closely collaborating to pursue means of increasing robotâ€™s functional autonomy, especially using the humanoid platform.</p>
<p>The main research subjects include: task and motion planning and control, multimodal interaction with human and surrounding environment through perception, and cognitive robotics. We host always more than ten foreign researchers, which characterizes the international atmosphere of this research group. We are actively conducting international collaborative research with French CNRS laboratories and also with research institutes through international research projects including EU projects.</p>
<p>The framework is identified as an International Research Laboratory (IRL) by both CNRS and  AIST.</p>
