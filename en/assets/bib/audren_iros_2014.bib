  abstract  = {Our work builds largely on Nagasaka\textquotesingle s stabilizer in multi-contact motion [1]. Using a sequence of contact stances from an offline multi-contact planner, we use first a Model Predictive Controller to generate a dynamic trajectory of the center of mass, then a whole-body closed-loop model-based controller to track it at best. Relatively to Nagasaka\textquotesingle s work, we allow frame changes of the preferred force, provide a heuristic to compute the timing of the transition from purely geometrical features and investigate the synchronization problem between the reduced-model preview control and the whole-body controller. Using our framework, we generate a wide range of 3D motions, while accounting for predictable external forces, which includes transporting objects. Simulation scenarios are presented and obtained results are analyzed and discussed.}
