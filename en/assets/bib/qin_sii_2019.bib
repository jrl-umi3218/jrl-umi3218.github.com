  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a four layers hierarchical framework to complete the cable installation task with a humanoid robot. By decoupling task planning layer and motion planning layer, flexibility of the framework is revealed. After symbolic relational representation and planning method is used in task planning layer, the planning result is then mapped to primitive manipulation action sequence in motion planning layer. By integrating position detection of operating points and humanoid walking, installation of a long cable on two industrial clamps with a certain distance was completed by humanoid robot HRP-2Kai.}
