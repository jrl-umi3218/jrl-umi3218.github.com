  abstract  = {Automation of large-scale aircraft manufacturing with wheeled or embedded platforms requires costly changes of the manufacturing process and the environment. Humanoid robots could address this issue. We present a use-case of HRP-4 humanoid operating circuit-breakers. We show the feasibility of using visual feedback and force control in an integrated and unified multi-contact and multimodal task space quadratic programming (QP) whole-body control framework to enable HRP-4 to perform the task. We discuss the experimental results and outline the limitations of the current platform design and control implementation.}
